This Python program demonstrates how to:

Transcribe live audio from a microphone using the Google Speech Recognition API.

Read and write .srt (subtitle) files using the srt Python module.

It's a foundation for building automated subtitle generators using speech input.

📌 Features
Live speech-to-text transcription using your microphone

Error handling for speech recognition

Framework to read and modify .srt files

Ready to expand into an automatic subtitle generator

🛠️ Requirements
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install PyAudio
pip install srt
For PyAudio installation issues:

Windows: pip install pipwin && pipwin install pyaudio

macOS/Linux: Use your package manager to install portaudio first.

🚀 How to Run
Save the script as transcribe_to_srt.py.

Open terminal in that directory.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python transcribe_to_srt.py
Note: Fix the line if _name_ == "_main_": to if __name__ == "__main__":

🧠 How It Works
🎤 Transcription
The transcribe_audio() function:

Listens via your microphone

Sends the audio to Google's API

Returns the recognized text or error message

📁 SRT Handling
The modify_srt() function:

Parses an existing .srt file

Allows editing its contents

Saves the modified subtitle file

🔧 The script currently does not generate new .srt content — that logic needs to be implemented.

🧪 Example Output
yaml
Copy
Edit
Say something!
Google thinks you said: Hello world
Transcribed Text: Hello world
📂 Future Improvements
Generate .srt content dynamically based on live transcription

Add timestamps to each phrase

Support saving full subtitle files

Accept audio files as input (not just live mic)
